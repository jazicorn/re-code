## About

The number one challenge for me learning to program was understand standard basic programming principles like functions and object. It's only recently that I've finally had an epiphany moment in releasing programming is just manipulating objects and functions is just one of the many vehicles to do so.

Something that I wish existed when I first started my programming journey was the ability to practice basics over and over and over again. As many times as it takes for one to understand those basic principles thoroughly.

Many learning programs do go through basic principles thoroughly, but you don't get that repetitious practice like you do in math. When you are just starting to learn math in elementary school you start off with the basics like: 
```markdown
1 + 1 = 2 
```
You practice 100's of these simple problems over and over again until you move on to slightly incrementally difficult topics and problems. This project is an attempt to create the programming version of basic math. Breaking programming principles down into micro bite size pieces that you can practice repeatedly. Forming almost rote like memory and basic and/or deep understanding of whatever topic and/or principle you're looking to improve in.
